## Gender Gap

This was an interesting article.  I have a latent knowledge sitting in my head about the power of advertising.  I had never looked at the long term impact of focused advertising.  Come to think of it many of the things we know as 'pop culture' references have been the result of long term marketing.
There were some amazing women pioneers in the world of computing, one of which was RDML Grace Hopper.  Gaming has always been the 'in' for a new burgeoning technology.  It is backed by data, which is good.  He does reach a little to cement his article, and I only say this because I am a video game history buff.  The console that *saved the video game industry* was the *Nintendo Entertainment System*.  They were, however, manufactured by the same company *Nintendo*.  If our class, coupled with who I see around the Codefellows campus is any indication of the whole, it seems as though we are balancing that trend out.  I am really happy to see that.

## Employee Breakdown

These are very interesting statistics.  It does point out that the overwhelming majority are white, while select other ethnicities are smaller represented, just looking at the *US Population* data against each company, it seems that those numbers are more a less a reflection of the population as a whole.  The excpetion being the Asian representation that seems to more than double than their population representation.  The data also supports the companies have a higher male representation, supporting the previous article.  While I don't doubt the numbers, they seem pretty solid enough, I am sure there are so many other factors to be considered to determine *why* the numbers are the way they are.  As always, more information will paint a clearer picture.  Perhaps to see a trend that could indicate we are at least moving in the right direction.

## Diversity Matters

I have read this article before and a few like it.  These speak volumes of how, not only tech professionals, but as a human race work best together.  Different ideas and different perspectives on thing are key to get innovative solutions.  In my previous career there was representation from all different cultures, genders, backgrounds and perspectives.  Often the "out-of-the-box" solutions came from the one person with a unique experience.  Diversity is definitely the fuel for the engine of innovation.

Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns

Tables should only have one purpose

First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key

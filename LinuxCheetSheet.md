# Linux Commands Cheat Sheet.. Should be pretty handy.

# Everything is a FILE!!  <-- Mind blown
# Gives ***zero @#$%s*** about extensions!

## Case Matters!

# use to group multiple words
+ '' such as `cd 'My Documents'/somethingSpecial/`
+ \ such as `cd My \Documents/somethingSpecial/`

## Print Working Directory 'pwd'

## List Files in a directory 'ls'
+ `-l` is a long list (Permissions, size, owner, Date, and Name)
+ `-a` will show ALL files (even the hidden ones)
### Can be combined `ls -la`

### Relative locations
- `./` to indicate relative location
- <space> to indicate a relative location (ie `cd Documents`)
### Absolute locations
- `/` such as `cd /etc`

## Check to see what type of file:
- `file myFile.txt`

## Go Up a Directory
- `cd ..` go to parent directory
- shortcut for you home directory `~/`

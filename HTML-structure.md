# Class 4: HTML Structures

## Chapter 18: Process and Design

A few interesting key point to remember here:

+ Ensure you are building the website for people that are *using* it, not for the builder.  **Build it for Grandma!**

+ Take some time to layout the site
  + What key elements need to go into the site
  + What information needs to be prominent?
+ Then begin to work on sizing and colors to draw the eye appropriately.  

+ Grouping is important to organize information for the end user

## Chapter 17: HTML5 tags<-- I know, out of order

HTML5 is a much more robust version of the markup language.  Consolidation of some tags for use in structuring the web page.

These are some key tags that I think will come in handy that I didn't know before.

+ `<hgroup>` used for grouping multiply &lt;h&gt; tags for the header
  + Good for use in an article too
+ `<nav>` used for navigation bars
+ `<article>` acts as a container for a section that could stand alone or be syndicated
+ `<aside>` contains information related to the page
  + if **inside** an article it's for relevant info for that article
+ `<figures>` contain information that is a reference from the main flow of the article

## Chapter 8: Extra Markup

So a few items here, that learned before in 101.  But one thing that solidified my understanding a little more was the difference between a **class** and a **id**.

A **class** is a tag that you can add to any other tags to group them together for CSS styling to be applied.  Kinda a one-stop-shop for formatting everything with the same class.

An **id** is specific to one item, so any formatting that CSS does will apply *ONLY* to that item.

Interesting read on the different versions of HTML.

Understanding the difference between **block** and **inline** elements.

Using **span** and  **div** to group elements together.

**meta**-information is important to get recognized by search engines.  Pretty important I think.  A quick way to get the details of a website.

aaaaaand... how to use the escape characters. Some of the characters you cannot normally use because they are either special (not on the keyboard), or used in the syntax.  use and ampersand & followed by the code.  For example, to get the cents symbol &cent; you would do this:

```&cent;```

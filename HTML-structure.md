# Class 4: HTML Structures

## Chapter 18: Process and Design

A few interesting key point to rememeber here:

+ Ensure you are building the website for people that are *using* it, not for the builder.  **Build it for Grandma!**

+ Take some time to layout the site
  + What key elements need to go into the site
  + What information needs to be prominent?
+ Then begin to work on sizing and colors to draw the eye appropriately.  

+ Grouping is important to organize information for the end user

## Chapter 17: HTML5 tage<-- I know, out of order

HTML5 is a much more robust version of the markup language.  Consolditation some tags for use in structuring the web page.

These are some key tags that I think will come in handy that I didn't know before.

+ `<hgroup>` used for grouping multiply <h> tags for the header
  + or in an article too
+ `<nav>` used for navigation bars
+ `<article>` acts as a container to for a section that could stand alone or be syndicated
+ `<aside>` contains information related to the page
  + if **inside** an article it's for relevant infor for that article
+ `<figures>` contain information that is reference from the main flowof the article

# Class 03 - Git and the Cloud

## Things I learned from the reading on Git.  

+ **GitHub** uses **git** under the hood
+ The most recent file or update is the **HEAD**
+ Always recall **ACP** -> *Add*, *Commit*, and *Push*
+ You can use the `.` to indicate all files
+ Always use commit and master when utilizing the push
  + ```git push origin master```

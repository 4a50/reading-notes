## Chapter 1C: Intro to JavaScript

This is the language part, that makes the website function.

It is a good rule of thumb to not put &lt;script&gt; into the HTML, better to write it into it's own file.

for now, just do it with the script tag:
```<script src="app.js" type="text/js"></script>```

Ensure the HTML doc knows where to look for it, much like CSS.

**NOTE** Never use ```document.write()``` &lt;-- it's an unsecure way display text.

**Good Practice**: keep your CSS and JS in seperate folder is good practice.  Keeps things nice and tidy!

## Video Notes

Really facinating to see some of the old mechanical computers.

All computers are basically the same.  4 requirements:
+Input
+Store
+Process
+Ouput

Really neat seeing sound represented as bits.  Pretty cool!

Pretty cool how the began to zoom out from binary to computers.

Smart fabrics are amazing.

Excellent simple description of how exactly a computer works.  I've understood for a while, but it was really well done

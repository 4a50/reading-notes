## Chapter 1C: Intro to JavaScript

This is the language part, that makes the website function.

It is a good rule of thumb to not put &lt;script&gt; into the HTML, better to write it into it's own file.

for now, just do it with the script tag:
```<script src="app.js" type="text/js"></script>```

Ensure the HTML doc knows where to look for it, much like CSS.

**NOTE** Never use ```document.write()``` &lt;-- it's an unsecure way display text.

**Good Practice**: keep your CSS and JS in seperate folder is good practice.  Keeps things nice and tidy!

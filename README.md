# Hello I am JP.  

## I am a person with way to many hobbies!  I hosted a podcast on retro gaming, I enjoy creating electronics, camping, making, and programming.  I have 3 kids and 3 dogs, so not a dull moment at this house.  

## Oh, and I love *Ghostbusters* more than most things in this world!

## What is Growth Mindset to me?

### It is pretty much something that has enabled me to get through my career.  In a high-tempo environment, you need to be able to take you lickings and keep rolling for the next challenge, and ask for help when you need it because you don't have all the answers.

### There are three things that I always remind to keep growing.
- That you may not have all the answers, but other do and will help you!
- Other have done the same thing, and have found a way!
- How do you eat an elephant?  One bite at a time?

# Operators and Loops

## javascript & jQuery

The syntax for an iterative loop is about the same as c#, so that is good.

```for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++>){Do things in a loop}```
 **Remember**  &lt;-- while loop will keep looping until it meets the condition

 ```while (i < 10) { keep doing things, and ensure you iterate through i.  Like i++}```

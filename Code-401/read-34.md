##  Graphs
[CodeFellows](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)

Graphs are broke up into two types
+ Directed (*aka Digraph*) - each vertex where every edge is directed
+ Undirected - each vertex is bi-directional

Components of a Graph
+ Vertex
+ Edge
+ Neighbor
+ Degree

Complete Graph - EveryNode is connected to all other nodes
Connected Graph - Every Node/Vertices have at least one edge

Disconnected - some vertices do not have edges

Acyclic and Cyclic - Can or cannot be cycled through

Adjacency Matrix - used for a Boolean matrix *2D Array*

Adjacency List - collection of Linked Lists or arrays that lists all othe other vertices that are connected

Can be traversed through via Breadth first or Depth First.

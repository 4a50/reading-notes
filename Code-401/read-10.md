# Notes for Read 10 - Stacks and Queues

[Codefellows - Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)

## Stack

A stack is a data structure that consists of *Nodes*.  Each Node references the *Next* node in the stack, but not it's previous

It is determined as a node that is **F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut

Or **L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut

Common Terms:
+ Pop - Remove the Top Node
+ Push - Add a Node to the Top
+ Peek - Look at the top node

BigO -> O(1) Space and Time

Takes the same amount of time regardless of how many nodes are present

## Queues

Queues are a Data structure that knows where the Front and the Rear are.

**F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut

**L**ast **I**n **L**ast **O**ut

Unique Terms (Not including Stack terms)

+ Enqueue - Nodes added to the queue via the **rear**
+ Dequeue - Nodes that are removed  via the **front**
+ Front
+ Rear
+ isEmpty - check if the queue is empty

BigO -> O(1) takes the same amount of time regardless of the number of nodes present

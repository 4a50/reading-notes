# Javascript Programming

## JQuery and Javascript book.

most of the function syntax is what I have seen before.

The format for decalring a function is:

```function Foo (params) {do what you need to do.  if you need something returned;  return what need to be returned}```

Calling a function

if you need something returned

```var star = Foo(params)```
if you don't need to have anything returned

```Foo(params)```

for javascript concantenation can be as simple as just adding the string together

**NOTE** All variable are declared as ```var```

```var spock = 'vulcan' + ', ' + 'human';```
